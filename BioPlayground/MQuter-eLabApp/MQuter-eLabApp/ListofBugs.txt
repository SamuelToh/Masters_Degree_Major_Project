List of known bugs
=====================

1) Parameter menu sometimes don't reflect the right change (when adding 3 activities then erase one, and replace one more the param line removal will start to fail)
1.1) Add on for point #1, bug can be replicated by first adding 2 activities then draw a line and remove the one with line drawn, line remainds in canvas (could be due to refresh of data context) new comp thus line ref lost forever.
2) When drag out of screen lines still gets kind of distorted
3) For loop on drag its inner input line does not follow the new position

Converting to production server
================================

1) DLL Loading point From local to http bin directory (fix) Not required anymore
//SR.ConnectionManager.AlternateProviderLocation = "C:\\Users\\Tendious\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\MQuter-eLaboratory\\MQuter-eLaboratory.Web\\bin\\";
SR.ConnectionManager.AlternateProviderLocation = System.Web.HttpRuntime.BinDirectory; //provider; //System.Web.HttpRuntime.BinDirectory;

2) Changing the location of WCF service
http://localhost:32019/Workflow WCF/WorkflowService.svc
http://bio.mquter.qut.edu.au/BioPlayground2010/Workflow%20WCF/WorkflowService.svc

3) Machine Name Tendious-PC to FITKGBL03

4) Deploy local DLL into bin folder
